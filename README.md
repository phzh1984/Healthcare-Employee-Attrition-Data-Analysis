# Healthcare-Employee-Attrition-Data-Analysis

Overview

The Employee Attrition Prediction in Healthcare project aims to address the critical issue of healthcare personnel attrition, which poses a significant challenge to the healthcare industry. 

Project Objectives

The healthcare industry plays a pivotal role in safeguarding and enhancing the well-being of individuals and communities. However, the attrition of healthcare personnel is becoming increasingly severe, potentially straining healthcare resources and affecting medical quality. The objectives of this project are:

Identify Influencing Factors: Explore the factors influencing healthcare personnel attrition and understand how they impact attrition rates.

Assess Significance: Determine which influencing factors have the most significant impact on attrition and analyse the directions of their effects.

Predict Attrition: Develop machine learning models for predicting attrition through computational analysis of the influencing factors.

Prevent Attrition: Formulate strategies to prevent healthcare personnel attrition in a targeted manner, providing recommendations for hospitals and governments.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains synthetic employee and company data tailored to the healthcare domain. It includes information relevant for supervised and unsupervised machine learning, as well as analytics. The key target variable is "Attrition," indicating whether an employee left or not.

Note: The dataset is based on the IBM Watson dataset for attrition, with modifications to align it with the healthcare context.
